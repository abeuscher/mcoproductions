What I tell them is that ever since I was a<br \/>young boy I have loved music, all kinds of music. I used to listen to my parents albums all the<br \/>time. Eventually they started to buy me my own records. When I was in high school I heard that<br \/>the senior class was trying to plan a Valentine&rsquo;s dance. By this time I had a good collection of<br \/>albums and 45 rpm&rsquo;s so I volunteered to help with the music and I also happened to know a bit<br \/>about hooking up stereo equipment. After that fateful night I was hooked. I soon convinced my<br \/>parents to allow me to buy some DJ equipment of my own and off I went. I started to do all of<br \/>the school dances. The money that they paid me went towards buying new music. After high<br \/>school I started to do private parties and weddings and I haven&rsquo;t stopped.<\/p>\n<p>While attending college I spent a summer at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting where I<br \/>learned how to be a radio DJ. I received my FCC license and started to work at some small radio<br \/>stations in the area. Being on the radio was great but it wasn&rsquo;t that same as being face to face<br \/>with people. There is something special about seeing a group of people getting together on the<br \/>dance floor and having fun.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been over twenty-five years since that fateful day and I have been a part of hundreds of<br \/>functions of all different types and sizes. I have traveled all over New England, from the shores<br \/>of York, Maine and Cape Cod to the busy cities of Boston and Providence, RI. I have been at<br \/>elegant weddings and relaxed backyard parties and everything in between. I have met thousands<br \/>of people throughout the years and I have a million memories.<\/p>\n<p>When I am not working I like to spend time with my family. I have been happily married for<br \/>nearly 20 years and we have two great kids. Our son Spencer is 18 yrs old and our daughter<br \/>Molly is 16 yrs old. Both love music like their father. I have played guitar for over 25 years and<br \/>over the last few years Spencer has started to play bass. It&rsquo;s always fun when we get to crank up<br \/>the amps and play together. I am thankful that he likes a lot of the same artists that I do. I am a<br \/>big fan of Van Halen, and guitar oriented rock music. I also have a soft spot for 80&rsquo;s music.<\/p>\n<p>The McIntyre&rsquo;s are also sports fans. My favorite sport is hockey so you can imagine how happy<br \/>I was when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup this past season. My all-time favorite player is Ray<br \/>Bourque. I have had the opportunity to meet him a few times and he is a class guy. We also<br \/>love watching the Red Sox and Patriots &ndash; Mrs. McIntyre is the only Celtics fan in the house.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for taking a few minutes to read this bio.<\/p>\n<p>- &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; -<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>References<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Reviews about working with MCO Productions and Pat:<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hi Patrick &ndash; Thanks you so much for doing an exceptional job at our wedding!!

Pat was absolutely fantastic, we couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better DJ. We were<br \/>short on time and only gave him some very basic guidelines, and he<br \/>knew exactly what to do. He was incredibly easy to work with,<br \/>thoughtful and very professional every step of the way. He listened to<br \/>our requests and helped to realize our vision of throwing a<br \/>sophisticated party where the crowd could still live it up on the<br \/>dance floor. He had everyone going (young and old) until last call.<br \/>And many of our guests stayed not only to the end, but hung around the<br \/>restaurant bar until closing time. It was exactly what we hoped for.<br \/>We can&rsquo;t recommend Pat more highly. He was incredible.&nbsp; Viviany<br \/>(Harvest, Cambridge)<\/p>","firstname":"Patrick","modified":1462254096,"_uid":"5636ddad47eacdoc1450577660","created":1462149290,"_id":"5726a0aa53bb5doc777186013","firstname_slug":"patrick","dj":true}],"text_blocks":[{"title_slug":"dj-services","content":"<h1>DJ SERVICES<\/h1>\n<p>We have a staff of experienced professional disc jockeys and masters of ceremony.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in booking a disc jockey for a wedding or other upcoming event, you can find testimonials, staff profiles, and contact us to check availability and rates.<\/p>","title":"DJ Services","modified":1484608666,"_uid":"5636ddad47eacdoc1450577660","created":1462012931,"_id":"57248c038799fdoc1161881411"},{"title_slug":"dj-event-services","content":"<h1>DJ &amp; EVENT SERVICES<\/h1>\n<p>Looking for a great way to spice up your next corporate event, or want to establish a weekly trivia game at your bar or restaurant?<\/p>\n<p>We are the leading provider of pub and event based trivia games in New England.
