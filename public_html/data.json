love of music started as a young teen growing up in NYC where we used to have \"crews\" that would go and spin music at various house parties.<\/p>\n<p>While attending high school at Phillips Andover Academy, I continued my love of music by studying classical guitar, music theory and music history. While there were no declared majors at PA, I was acknowledged during commencement as graduating with honors in music and also reveived the Mark Larner Fellowship in The Arts. I continued to study classical guitar performance and music history during my first year at Oberlin College. Also while at Oberlin, a group of friends and I used to DJ at various parties around campus.<\/p>\n<p>While I do not study or perform any more, I have a great love for classical and other musical styles that is demonstrated during intimate cocktail functions.<\/p>\n<p>My professional DJ experience started by doing computerized light shows at Hurricane O'Reillys, a Downtown Boston nightclub. While there, DJ Dan of DM Productions started to teach me how to use professional DJ equipment, how to put sets of music together and how to eventually open the night until his arrival. I continued to work with him there and at other functions until working a recurring gig at the former T's Pub, a once well-known sports bar in Brighton.<\/p>\n<p>While at T's Pub, I was also hired by DJ Michael of MCO Productions. By working with him, I further learned the elements of beat mixing, music selection and reading the crowd to keep them entertained. To date, I have worked over 100 weddings and various other functions with MCO Productions and still continue to work for the company today.<\/p>","_modified":1486785462,"_created":1486785462,"_id":"589e8bb6a7375doc668685235"},{"firstname":"Patrick","lastname":"","photo":"","dj":true,"blurb":"<p class=\"first-para\">People often ask me how I got into this line of work. What I tell them is that ever since I was a<br \/>young boy I have loved music, all kinds of music. I used to listen to my parents albums all the<br \/>time. Eventually they started to buy me my own records. When I was in high school I heard that<br \/>the senior class was trying to plan a Valentine&rsquo;s dance. By this time I had a good collection of<br \/>albums and 45 rpm&rsquo;s so I volunteered to help with the music and I also happened to know a bit<br \/>about hooking up stereo equipment. After that fateful night I was hooked. I soon convinced my<br \/>parents to allow me to buy some DJ equipment of my own and off I went. I started to do all of<br \/>the school dances. The money that they paid me went towards buying new music. After high<br \/>school I started to do private parties and weddings and I haven&rsquo;t stopped.<\/p>\n<p>While attending college I spent a summer at the Connecticut School of Broadcasting where I<br \/>learned how to be a radio DJ. I received my FCC license and started to work at some small radio<br \/>stations in the area. Being on the radio was great but it wasn&rsquo;t that same as being face to face<br \/>with people. There is something special about seeing a group of people getting together on the<br \/>dance floor and having fun.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s been over twenty-five years since that fateful day and I have been a part of hundreds of<br \/>functions of all different types and sizes. I have traveled all over New England, from the shores<br \/>of York, Maine and Cape Cod to the busy cities of Boston and Providence, RI. I have been at<br \/>elegant weddings and relaxed backyard parties and everything in between. I have met thousands<br \/>of people throughout the years and I have a million memories.<\/p>\n<p>When I am not working I like to spend time with my family. I have been happily married for<br \/>nearly 20 years and we have two great kids. Our son Spencer is 18 yrs old and our daughter<br \/>Molly is 16 yrs old. Both love music like their father. I have played guitar for over 25 years and<br \/>over the last few years Spencer has started to play bass. It&rsquo;s always fun when we get to crank up<br \/>the amps and play together. I am thankful that he likes a lot of the same artists that I do. I am a<br \/>big fan of Van Halen, and guitar oriented rock music. I also have a soft spot for 80&rsquo;s music.<\/p>\n<p>The McIntyre&rsquo;s are also sports fans. My favorite sport is hockey so you can imagine how happy<br \/>I was when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup this past season. My all-time favorite player is Ray<br \/>Bourque. I have had the opportunity to meet him a few times and he is a class guy. We also<br \/>love watching the Red Sox and Patriots &ndash; Mrs. McIntyre is the only Celtics fan in the house.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for taking a few minutes to read this bio.<\/p>\n<p>- &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; - &ndash; -<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>References<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>Reviews about working with MCO Productions and Pat:<br \/><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Hi Patrick &ndash; Thanks you so much for doing an exceptional job at our wedding!!

He listened to<br \/>our requests and helped to realize our vision of throwing a<br \/>sophisticated party where the crowd could still live it up on the<br \/>dance floor. He had everyone going (young and old) until last call.<br \/>And many of our guests stayed not only to the end, but hung around the<br \/>restaurant bar until closing time.
